  433toMQTTto433  - ESP8266 program for home automation 

   Act as a wifi gateway between your 433mhz nodes and a MQTT broker 
   Send and receiving command by MQTT
 
  This program enables to:
 - receive MQTT data from a topic and send RF 433Mhz signal corresponding to the received MQTT data
 - publish MQTT data to a different topic related to received 433Mhz signal

  Contributor:

  Based on:
  - MQTT library (https://github.com/knolleary)
  - RCSwitch (https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch)
  - ESP8266Wifi

Some usefull commands to test gateway with mosquitto:
Subscribe to the subject for data receiption from RF signal
mosquitto_sub -t home/433toMQTT

Send data by MQTT to convert it on RF signal
mosquitto_pub -t home/MQTTto433/ -m 1315153
